# **App Name**: Logicit Systems

## Core Features:

- Impactful Hero Section: Display a silent video loop showcasing dashboards, web apps, mobile apps, and system diagrams in black, white, gray, and a single blue accent (#0000FF) with slow, precise transitions to communicate complex software development and architectural expertise.
- Visual Method Proof: Showcase the company's methodology via scroll-driven animation that transitions from a chaotic system (disordered UI, broken processes) to an organized system (clean UI) after introducing the modular architecture.  This demonstrates the value of structured architectural design.
- Service Presentation: Use a split-screen layout to present core services without using a typical 'service menu.'  On the left, use clear and concise text.  On the right, display videos/animations of system architecture, module connections, and data flows.
- Software Development Showcase: Display real diagrams of processes to illustrate the phases of software development, with emphasis on diagnosis, architecture, development, automation, and scalability.
- Technology Emphasis: Present code snippets and clear UIs to show command of multiple technologies, but with the purpose of showing the technology as an implementation tool and not as a goal in itself.
- Ideal Client Definition: Clearly define target clients as growing companies, businesses with complex processes, and teams that need control and scalability. Explicitly state the company does not serve projects, quick solutions, or software without architecture.
- Results Display: Present realistic mockups showcasing apps that implement architecture to produce 'operational clarity.'  Mockups to include business web app, mobile app, and dashboard.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Strong Blue (#3B82F6), is modern and professional to align with their software architecture focus.
- Background color: Light Gray (#F9FAFB), providing a neutral backdrop that emphasizes the digital system aesthetic. It keeps the focus on content and functionality rather than being decorative.
- Accent color: Darker Shade of Blue (#1E3A8A) creates emphasis on interactive elements and important information. The accent enhances readability without distracting from the content. This maintains a tech-forward look.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', sans-serif. The user requested Inter, which offers a clean and modern aesthetic suitable for displaying large amounts of technical data. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- No decorative icons are desired. Use functional icons in the brand's blue to represent key actions, such as system modules connecting, data flowing, etc.
- Adopt a blueprint-style layout with a subtle grid visible in the background. The content shall contain real diagrams with boxes, arrows, and modules in multiple layers to maintain an organized interface.
- Transitions need to be slow and precise. No flashy transitions shall be permitted. Add Granulated textures subtly.
